			<p class="abstract"> The contradiction of overexposure, a debate on how the ubiquity of images shapes our ability to feel, was the theme of the seventh edition of PhotoVogue Festival, the first conscious fashion photography festival that focuses on the common ground between ethics and aesthetics. With the presence of more than 50 of the artists involved, the programme contained many events including a masterclass by Alfredo Jaar entitled “Teach Us to Outgrow our Madness”, which opened the festival, a talk with the journalist and author David Rieff, panels with Yashica Olden, Yelena Yemchuk, Aïda Muluneh and Roe Ethridge, leading figures in the photography landscape such as Fred Ritchin and Susie Linfield, and with Emanuele Coccia, Maria Luisa Frisa and Vogue’s European Editorial Director, Edward Enninful. The festival took place at BASE Milano and it displayed six different exhibitions, dedicated to social and political subjects and conscious fashion photography.</p>
